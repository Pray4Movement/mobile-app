# Native Android Prototype Plan

## Rule Compliance

- Checked for `.cursor/rules`; none found, so only system/user/developer rules apply.

## Phase 1 – Project Foundations

- app-setup: Confirm `native-android` Gradle sync, enable Jetpack Compose, configure Kotlin options, material3 theme.
- navigation-scaffold: Establish `MainActivity` in `native-android/app/src/main/java/.../MainActivity.kt` with Compose `NavHost` and bottom navigation for `PrayerFeed`, `Campaigns`, `CampaignChooser`.

## Phase 2 – Hard-Coded Data & Models

- data-models: Define data classes (`Campaign`, `PrayerFuel`, `ReminderSchedule`) and sample fixtures in `data/StaticContentProvider.kt`.
- repository-layer: Implement in-memory repositories (`CampaignRepository`, `PrayerFuelRepository`, `ReminderRepository`) backed by fixtures, exposing flows for UI state.
- state-holders: Create `ViewModel`s per screen consuming repositories (no API calls).

## Phase 3 – Screen Implementations

- campaign-chooser-ui: Build Compose screen with search field, language/group filters, subscription badges, campaign code input, grouped lists showing counts.
- prayer-feed-ui: Render reminder summary, editable schedules (static dialog), daily prayer fuel list with prayed indicator and navigation into details.
- prayer-fuel-ui: Render block-based content (headings, paragraphs, bullet lists, image placeholders) from hard-coded JSON-like structures; include share & language controls, `I prayed` state toggle returning to feed.
- campaigns-ui: Display subscribed campaigns with kebab menu options (stub dialogs), navigation to chooser.

## Phase 4 – Interactions & System Features

- subscription-logic: Wire subscribe/unsubscribe flows, mark prayed state, persist selections in memory (simulate storage with `rememberSaveable` / simple singleton store).
- reminder-engine: Implement reminder editor UI backed by a scheduling layer using `AlarmManager`/`WorkManager` to create exact alarms (within prototype limits), including runtime permission prompts for `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` when required.
- notification-routing: Implement notification channel creation, PendingIntent deep links to `PrayerFuel`, and full tap handling lifecycle.
- share-intents: Integrate Android Sharesheet intents for app/campaign sharing using static text.

## Phase 5 – Testing & Polish

- theming-polish: Ensure consistent theming, typography, spacing, and accessible contrast for badges and buttons.
- state-testing: Add unit tests for repositories/ViewModels in `app/src/test/...` validating filtering, grouping, prayed toggles.
- ui-checklist: Run manual QA script verifying screen flows, hard-coded data coverage, navigation edges, and reminder stubs.
- documentation: Update `docs/` with prototype limitations (hard-coded data, stubbed notifications) and setup instructions for running locally.

## Implementation Todos

- app-setup: Configure Compose, themes, navigation shell.
- data-models: Implement data fixtures and repositories.
- screens: Build all four screens with static data integration.
- interactions: Hook up subscribe/pray/reminder/share flows.
- polish-test-docs: Finalize UI polish, add tests, document prototype notes.
